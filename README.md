# Iris-Image-Processing
To introduce you to our project,i would first like to shed light on the disease
 which is being diagnosed in our project.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of kidney disease
 in which there is gradual loss of kidney function.
In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. 
When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage,
 dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in our body.
This disease has an effect on the iris curvatures thus an early diagnosis
 can be done using an unconventional diagnosing technique by the help of Iridology.
it is the study of pattern and fiber arrangement of the iris. 
In particular the eye organ more precisely iris 
have particular merits that can store all the 
psychological and organ condition including construction of the body.
